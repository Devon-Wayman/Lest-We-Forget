Requirements & Setup
--------------------
1) This version of Beautify only works with High Definition Rendering Pipeline (HDRP 7.1.8 or later).
2) Make sure you have High Definition RP package imported in the project before importing Beautify to avoid compilation errors.
3) Make sure you have a High Definition RP asset assigned to Project Settings / Graphics. There's a HDRP sample asset in Demo folder.
4) Assign Beautify to the "After Post Process" list in Project Settings / HDRP Default Settings.

If you want to animate some properties at runtime using scripting, take a look at Demo.cs in the demo scene for some code examples.


Demo Scene
----------
There's a demo scene which lets you quickly check if Beautify is working correctly in your project.
