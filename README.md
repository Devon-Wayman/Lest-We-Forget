<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/Devon-Wayman/Lest-We-Forget)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Being the sole creator of this application for the last 6 years has taken much time, caffeiene and Tylenol.
Making contributions to the project via the open source community not only helps with taking some of the weight off, but also helps myself as well as others
who view the repo in learning new methods of solving problems, and inspires others to move forward with their ideas. Any contribution to the project made is highly appreciated!
Whether it be a bug fix, feature addition, or anything else you believe would enhance the user's experience.

The process for making a contribution if you wish to do so are as follows

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Added some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/your-new-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
