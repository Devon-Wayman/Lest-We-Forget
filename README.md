## About The Project

Lest We Forget has been in development for over 6 years. What started as a simple AR app made in my free time would later become a much larger scale project.

<!-- [![AR App Preview][ar-app]] -->

When I was able to have access to VR equipment for the first time in my life via my university, I realized first-hand the power VR held when it came to increasing user immersion in a variety of situations.

Between classes, projects, study hours and sleeping, I found myself researching VR 

The major goals of this application:
* Teach a variety of ages about the WWII era
* Increase people's appreciation of history through the use of modern tech
* Allow those that may be unable to have access to museums an alternate method of learning

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources in which I have obtained plethora of information are listed in the acknowledgements below.

Lest We Forget can be used as a teaching tool to educate the general public about a period in history that has since only been taught via books, films, and television documentaries. With the ability to enable parental controls, people of all ages can enjoy

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Devon-Wayman/Lest-We-Forget/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Making contributions to the project via the open source community not only helps with taking some of the weight off, but also helps myself as well as others
who view the repo in learning new methods of solving problems, and inspires others to move forward with their ideas. Any contribution to the project made is highly appreciated!
Whether it be a bug fix, feature addition, or anything else you believe would enhance the user's experience. Please follow this template for contributing to the project:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch
  * If you are contributing a new feature, please have your branch name begin with "feature", followed
    by a forward slash and a basic name description. Example: (`git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature`)
  * Same goes for a bug fix. Example: (`git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Basic description here'`)
4. Push to the Branch you created
5. Open a Pull Request

PLEASE NOTE: In order to keep things clean, please submit one feature or bug fix per PR.
Having a multitude of refactored code submitted all at once may present problems in the future so for the time being we ask that each PR have one main fix focused on. Thank you in advance :)
